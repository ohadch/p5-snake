# Snake Game
This is a simple snake game built using the p5.js library. The game allows you to control a snake that grows in length each time it eats food, and the game restarts if the snake goes out of bounds or runs into itself.

## Features
- Control the snake using arrow keys.
- Snake grows when eating food.
- The game restarts if the snake touches the boundaries.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Start the server using Docker Compose `docker-compose up -d`.
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8110`.
